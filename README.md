#### 🔐 Re-Auth Dialog (`components/re-auth-dialog.tsx`)
- 🚨 **Triggers when severe anomalies are detected**
- 🔄 **Provides seamless re-authentication flow**

### 📊 Behavioral Metrics Tracked

| 📈 Metric | 📝 Description | ⚖️ Weight |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| ⌨️ Typing Rate | Keys per second | 35% |
| 🖱️ Mouse Speed | Pixels per second | 35% |
| 🖱️ Click Patterns | Click frequency and timing | 15% |
| ⏸️ Idle Ratio | Inactivity periods | 15% |

### 🎯 Anomaly Scoring
- 🟢 **Score 0-2.0**: Normal behavior
- 🟡 **Score 2.2-3.4**: Moderate anomaly (logged)
- 🔴 **Score 3.5+**: Severe anomaly (triggers re-auth)
